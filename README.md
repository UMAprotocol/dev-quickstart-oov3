This repository contains example contracts and tests for integrating with the UMA Optimistic Oracle V3.

## Documentation üìö

Full documentation on how to build, test, deploy and interact with the example contracts in this repository are
 documented [here](https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/optimistic-oracle).

This project uses [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). See the [book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)
 for instructions on how to install and use Foundry.

## Getting Started üë©‚Äçüíª

### Install dependencies üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

On Linux and macOS Foundry toolchain can be installed with:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

In case there was a prior version of Foundry installed, it is advised to update it with `foundryup` command.

Other installation methods are documented [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Forge manages dependencies using [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) by default, which
 is also the method used in this repository. To install dependencies, run:

```bash
forge install
```

### Compile the contracts üèó

Compile the contracts with:

```bash
forge build
```

### Run the tests üß™

Test the example contracts with:

```bash
forge test
```

## Sandboxed Optimistic Oracle environment üöÄ

In order to experiment with the dispute flow on deployed example contracts, it might be useful to deploy a sandboxed
 Optimistic Oracle environment where dispute resolution is handled by a mock Oracle. This requires exporting following
 environment variables:
- `ETH_RPC_URL`: URL of the RPC node to use for broadcasting deployment transactions.
- `MNEMONIC`: Mnemonic of the account to use for deployment.
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: API key for Etherscan, used for verifying deployed contracts.
- `DEFAULT_IDENTIFIER`: Default identifier used by Optimistic Oracle V3 when resolving disputes. If not provided, this
 defaults to `ASSERT_TRUTH` identifier.
- `DEFAULT_LIVENESS`: Default liveness in seconds used by Optimistic Oracle V3 when settling assertions. If not
 provided, this defaults to `7200` seconds.
- `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`: Default currency used by Optimistic Oracle V3 when bonding assertions and disputes. If not
 provided, the script would also deploy a mintable ERC20 token and use it as the default currency based on following
 parameters:
  - `DEFAULT_CURRENCY_NAME`: Name of the new token. If not provided, this defaults to `Default Bond Token`.
  - `DEFAULT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL`: Symbol of the new token. If not provided, this defaults to `DBT`.
  - `DEFAULT_CURRENCY_DECIMALS`: Number of decimals of the new token. If not provided, this defaults to `18`.
- `MINIMUM_BOND`: Minimum bond amount in Wei of default currency required by Optimistic Oracle V3 when accepting new
 assertions. If not provided, this defaults to `100e18` Wei.

The sandboxed environment can be deployed and verified with:

```bash
forge script \
--broadcast \
--fork-url $ETH_RPC_URL \
--mnemonics "$MNEMONIC" \
--sender $(cast wallet address --mnemonic "$MNEMONIC") \
--verify \
script/OracleSandbox.s.sol
```

On other networks than Ethereum the verification might require additional `--verifier-url` parameter with URL of the
 verification API endpoint.

At the top of the script output the addresses of the deployed contracts should be logged. These will be required when
 deploying example contracts. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/optimistic-oracle)
 for more details on how to use this sandboxed environment.
